/*
 * The Message ID (msgid) framework provides a lightweight alternative to
 * UUIDs in allowing host-unique identifiers to be associated with ephemeral
 * kernel objects (most typically, IPC messages of various sorts).  Rather
 * than ensuring strong global uniqueness (i.e., across hosts), message IDs
 * must provide a host-local unique identifier produced in a highly affordable
 * way so as to be used in critical fast paths (such as IPC send).  And,
 * unlike UUIDs, the assumption is that a message ID will only be unique for
 * the current boot -- some external mechanism must be used to disambiguate
 * message IDs generated during one boot from message IDs generated in
 * another.
 *
 * This is currently accomplished through the use of per-CPU ID spaces, in
 * which each CPU is delegated its own portion of a larger space, through
 * which it increments.  It is assumed that the log(CPUs) space taken up by a
 * unique CPU identifier in each message ID still leaves sufficient bits of
 * uniqueness that incrementing through the remaining portion of a 64-bit
 * integer will be sufficient to count all message-send events that might be
 * experienced in a particular boot.  This might be called into question if
 * the number of cores gets too high.
